Group texting app with built in functionality for adding/removing members, changing member names, and Evernote note saving functions. Evertext is designed to work well for professional, work-oriented projects as well as for social, friendly communication as well.

Technology used include Twilio API, and Evernote API to work directly from your phone's default texting application.

Because of the Evernote functions, any user regardless of the type of device they use (Android, iPhone, Windows etc.) can save important messages directly to their note taking app easily instead of having to worry about scrolling through walls of text to find the nuggets of information that they need.
